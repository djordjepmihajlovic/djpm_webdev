I'm a 1st year PhD maths student based at the University of Edinburgh, jointly supervised by Davide Michielleto & Tudor Dimofte. I work primarily on the intersection between pure and applied mathematics using machine learning to investigate problems in knot theory spanning both protein folding and topological invariants.
