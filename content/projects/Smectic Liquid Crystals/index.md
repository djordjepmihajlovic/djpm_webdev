title: 3D Smectic Liquid Crystals
subtitle: Summer Project 2023 with Dr. Tyler Shendruk
summary: During the summer of 2023 I was funded to work on a project concerning the development of 3D smectic liquid crystal simulation in C++ and Python. My work concerned developing methods to constrain tensors to physically realizable states using lagrangian multipliers.
